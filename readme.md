#GQLVIZ

This is an experimental GraphQL introspection exploration tool. The idea is to evolve this project into something similar to [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), but with less typing and more clicking.

It uses runs on NodeJS + Express on the back end, and Angular2 with TypeScript on the front.
